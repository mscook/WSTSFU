WSTSFU
======

WorkSheet To Something Fucking Useful =  WSTSFU. Free clinical metadata
relating to NGS experiments from Excel documents


Too often the clinical metadata relating to NGS experiments comes in the form  
of a Micro$oft Excel spreadsheet. This increasingly frustrates the 
Bioinformatician.

*This may be a useful joke*

WSTSFU is a simple wrapper around csvkit.
